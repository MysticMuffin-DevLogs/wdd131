        <div class="card">
          <p>
            Manatees, often referred to as "sea cows," are large, gentle marine
            mammals found in warm coastal waters. They have a distinct, rounded
            body with a broad, flat tail that helps them glide gracefully
            through the water. These herbivores primarily feed on seagrasses and
            other aquatic plants, spending much of their day foraging. Despite
            their large size, manatees are slow-moving creatures, typically
            traveling at speeds of around 5 miles per hour. Unfortunately,
            manatees face threats from habitat loss, boat collisions, and
            pollution, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.
